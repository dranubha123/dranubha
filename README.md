Do you take your skin for granted? Most of us do. Whatever daily routine we follow, usually nothing happens to our skin. But for many people skin infection is a part of life, which adds to their worries. Skin disease has not only impact on skin; it decreases persons’ self-confidence which leads to depression. Just like any other disorder, skin disease has its own severity, so it’s the time to take it seriously.
